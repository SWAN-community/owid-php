/**
 * Fetches the signing public key of a creator from the well known end point
 * on the domain the OWID carries, asking for the key that was in force on the
 * date the OWID carries.
 *
 * The end point is /owid/api/v{n}/public-key?date={minutes}&format=pkcs,
 * where the version in the path is the version byte of the OWID being checked
 * rather than a constant, and the minutes are counted from 2020-01-01 in the
 * same way the OWID stores the date. Creators rotate weekly, so without the
 * date only identifiers signed since the most recent rotation can be verified
 * and every older one reads as not matching. A creator that ignores the
 * parameter returns its current key, so every identifier it signed under an
 * earlier key reads as not matching, which is why a creator that rotates its
 * key has to honour the date.
 *
 * Only the HTTP stream wrapper PHP ships with is used, so the library keeps
 * its promise of no external dependency. This class is the one place in the
 * library that reaches the network, nothing else loads it, and every method
 * takes a transport of the caller's own for a host where remote stream access
 * is turned off or another client is wanted.
 *
 * The Java port answers the same question with PublicKeyFetch, the Rust port
 * with Owid::verify_status and the Go port with SignatureStatusFromDomain.
